        "user_input": "Three of the words will be in the same classification, the remaining one will not be. Your answer will be the one word that does NOT belong in the same classification as the others. Which word does NOT belong with the others? options a)guitar  b)flute  c)violin  d)cello",
        "response": "**d) cello**\n\nGuitar, flute, and violin are all string instruments. Cello, on the other hand, is a stringed instrument of the violin family, but it is played by resting it between the legs rather than holding it against the shoulder. Therefore, cello is the one that does not belong in the same classification as the others."
