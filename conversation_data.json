        "user_input": "(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab, why?",
        "response": "The formula (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab is known as the square of a binomial. It can be proven using the distributive property of multiplication over addition.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n(a+b)^2 = (a+b)(a+b)\n\nExpanding the right side using the distributive property:\n\n(a+b)^2 = a(a+b) + b(a+b)\n\nDistributing a and b:\n\n(a+b)^2 = a^2 + ab + ba + b^2\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\nTherefore, (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's consider a+b = 3+4 = 7.\n\n(a+b)^2 = 7^2 = 49\n\na^2 + b^2 + 2ab = 3^2 + 4^2 + 2(3)(4) = 9 + 16 + 24 = 49\n\nAs you can see, both sides of the equation evaluate to the same value, confirming the validity of the formula."
