Exit the loop.**\n4. **If n is not divisible by any number in the loop, then n is prime.**\n\n**Example:**\n\nTo find all prime numbers up to 100, follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with n = 2.\n2. Loop through all numbers from 2 to the square root of n (which is 10).\n3. 2 is divisible by 2, so it is not prime.\n4. 3 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 10, so it is prime.\n5. Continue looping through all numbers up to 100, and apply the same process to each number.\n\nThe following numbers up to 100 are prime:\n\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^(1/2)), where n is the input number.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis algorithm can be optimized using various techniques, such as:\n\n- **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** A more efficient algorithm for finding prime numbers up to a given limit.\n- **Primality Test:** Algorithms that can quickly determine if a given number is prime or not."

In this case, the sum of the digits in the total number is 813, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, the total number is also divisible by 3, and the remainder when it is divided by 3 is **0**."
